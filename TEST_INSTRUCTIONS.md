# Test Suite Instructions

The comprehensive test suite (`test_vite_migration.py`) is now running at:
**http://localhost:8506**

## Important Notes:

### For Development Mode Testing:
The Vite dev server is currently running on port **3002** (not the default 3000).

However, the component expects it on port 3000. So for now:
1. **Use Production Mode** (default) - This works perfectly!
2. Or kill other processes using port 3000 and restart Vite

### What to Test:

1. **Basic Tests Tab**
   - Check that import succeeds âœ…
   - Click the test button
   - Watch the click counter

2. **Visual Tests Tab**
   - Try all button types
   - Test icons (save, settings, etc.)
   - Check full width button
   - Try the custom colors button

3. **Interaction Tests Tab**
   - Click multiple buttons rapidly
   - Test all 18 icons in the grid
   - Check that each button works independently

4. **Build Tests Tab**
   - Click "Run Production Build" to test building
   - Check the file outputs

5. **Performance Tab**
   - View bundle sizes (should show ~320KB for JS)
   - Try the render performance test

## Expected Results:
- All buttons should be clickable
- Icons should render correctly
- Dark mode should work automatically
- Bundle size should be significantly smaller than CRA

The component is working great in Production mode!
