# Vite Migration Complete ðŸŽ‰

The streamlit-carbon-button component has been successfully migrated from Create React App to Vite!

## What Changed

### âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Vite Configuration**
   - Created `frontend/vite.config.ts` with optimized settings for Streamlit components
   - Maintains CRA's file structure for backward compatibility

2. **Package.json Updates**
   - Removed `react-scripts` dependency
   - Added Vite and @vitejs/plugin-react
   - Updated scripts to use Vite commands
   - Added `"type": "module"` for ESM support

3. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Created modern TypeScript config for Vite
   - Separated node and browser TypeScript settings

4. **Entry Point**
   - Created `frontend/index.html` as Vite's entry point
   - Updated React 18 render method using `createRoot`

5. **Build Process**
   - Build output remains in `frontend/build/` directory
   - Static assets follow CRA's naming convention

## How to Use

### Development Mode
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Install new dependencies
npm start    # Start Vite dev server on http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
./build.sh   # Copies built files to briquette/frontend/
```

### Testing the Component
```bash
pip install -e .
python minimal_test.py
```

## Benefits of Vite

- **âš¡ Faster Development**: Near-instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- **ðŸ“¦ Smaller Bundles**: Better tree-shaking and optimization
- **ðŸš€ Faster Builds**: 10-100x faster than CRA
- **ðŸŽ¯ Better DX**: Modern tooling and error messages
- **ðŸ”§ Simpler Config**: Less boilerplate, more intuitive setup

## Next Steps

1. Test the component thoroughly in both dev and production modes
2. Compare bundle sizes (expected 50-70% reduction)
3. Run visual regression tests to ensure UI consistency
4. Update CI/CD pipelines if any

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to CRA:
1. The original CRA config is preserved in git history
2. Restore `frontend/package.json` from commit before migration
3. Delete Vite-specific files (vite.config.ts, index.html, tsconfig.*.json)
4. Run `npm install` to restore CRA dependencies
